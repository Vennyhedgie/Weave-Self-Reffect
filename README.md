# Notes

There are other, more visible packs out there for this effect, but this one is focused on trying to stay consistent with the game's existing UI artstyle sensibilities, so it's fairly minimalist.

This effect is made with Normal interface size. If you use a different one, you can resize all the elements at once by right-clicking on the pack and selecting resize. Alternatively, you can move the pack's position on screen if needed, though it should be aligned by default.
